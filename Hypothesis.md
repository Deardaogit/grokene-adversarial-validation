# Technical Hypothesis Overview

System:
Ni-doped twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG)

Core Mechanism:
Flat-band correlation enhancement in moiré superlattice regime

Conservative Tc target:
~80K exploratory (not claimed)

Critical Variables:
- Twist angle: 1.05° / 1.10° / 1.15°
- Ni supply thickness: 0 / 0.2 / 1 / 5 nm
- UHV anneal conditions

Key Risk:
Metalization and shorting artifacts

This hypothesis is exploratory and requires rigorous artifact exclusion.
