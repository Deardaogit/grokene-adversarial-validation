# Grokene — Adversarial AI Validation Archive

⚠️ This repository does NOT claim superconductivity.

It documents a structured adversarial validation process using AI (Grok vs GPT)
to refine a Ni-doped twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) superconductivity hypothesis
into a falsifiable experimental protocol.

## 1. Executive Summary

We initiated an AI-mediated adversarial review process to:

- Identify theoretical inconsistencies
- Stress-test energy scales and gap ratios
- Evaluate model robustness
- Transition from speculation to lab-ready protocol
- Define strict artifact exclusion criteria

The outcome is not a discovery claim.
It is a reproducible experimental design with explicit fail conditions.

## 2. Why This Exists

Recent superconductivity claims (e.g., LK-99) failed due to:

- Insufficient artifact control
- Lack of reproducibility safeguards
- Incomplete magnetic validation
- Ambiguous transport data

This archive prioritizes falsifiability and reproducibility first.

## 3. Final State of Hypothesis

Material class:
Ni-doped magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG)

Hypothesized regime:
Strong flat-band correlations

Conservative target:
High-Tc (~80K) exploratory hypothesis

Room-temperature superconductivity:
Speculative — not claimed.

## 5. Philosophy

If it fails → publish the failure.
If it works → it must survive independent replication.

This is a falsifiable protocol, not a breakthrough announcement.
