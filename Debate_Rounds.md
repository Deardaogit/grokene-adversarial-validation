# Adversarial Debate Summary

## Round 1 — Internal Consistency Failure
- Δ/Tc ratio inconsistent
- Overestimated pairing gap
→ Mechanism revised

## Round 2 — Two-Gap Stabilization
- Δ1 = 23 meV
- Δ2 = 6 meV
- Ratio moved into unconventional range

## Round 3 — Experimental Reality
- DOE matrix introduced (12 samples)
- Yield corrected to ~15%

## Round 4 — Fabrication Refinement
- Switched to tear-and-stack tBLG
- UHV-only anneal
- Raman/Hall screening

## Round 5 — Execution Protocol
- Thickness sweep (0 / 0.2 / 1 / 5 nm)
- Explicit fail gates
- FAIR data structure

Outcome:
Theory reduced. Controls increased.
