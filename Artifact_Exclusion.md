# Artifact Exclusion Protocol

Fail Gate 1:
Room-temperature sheet resistance drop >50% → discard

Fail Gate 2:
Raman I(D)/I(G) > 0.5 → discard

Fail Gate 3:
Field-independent resistance drop → suspect artifact

Controls required:
- Contact geometry variation
- Electrode metal variation
- Off-angle control samples
