# AI Adversarial Validation Methodology

Two AI systems (Grok & GPT) were used to:

- Identify internal inconsistencies
- Demand cross-validation
- Reduce over-optimistic modeling
- Force transition from theory to experiment

Rule hierarchy:
1. Falsification priority
2. Energy scale consistency
3. Model coherence
4. Reproducibility enforcement

AI did not 'discover' superconductivity.
It filtered weak hypotheses into testable form.
